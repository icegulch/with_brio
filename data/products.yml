    Looking for a quick way to visualize all 46 of the Adirondack High Peaks? This poster might be for you!

Given for each summit is a difficulty rating, elevation in feet and meters, elevation rank, summit type, trail type, county, and region. Region colors reflect the 2020 re-zoning of the High Peaks by the NY Department of Enviornmental Conservation, while subtle shading differences preserve historic boundaries. To accommodate our Québecois friends to the north, the poster's legend is translated into French. Chapeau, randonneurs francophones!! Offset-printed on 80lb paper with an endurance gloss cover.

  blurb: |
    Reminiscent of vintage scientific identification posters, this print challenges you to become familiar with the topographic &quot;fingerprints&quot; of all of New Hampshire&#x27;s 4000-Footers. Adapted from the USGS &quot;US Topo&quot; series contour lines, the fingerprints are foil stamped in silver matte on 100# Neenah Classic Crest "patriot blue" paper. Since summits vary greatly in size, creative license was invoked in fitting each peak into a grid. Indeed, many summit shapes were reduced in size, with contour lines pruned in as systematic a way as possible. In two cases (Lincoln and Wildcat B), contours were added to give a better sense of those two summits&#x27; shapes.

  blurb: |
    On those magical <a href='https://youtu.be/bf69enjayjg' target='_blank'>undercast</a> days, when clouds settle in valleys and summits peek out above, you might find the landscape more nautical than orographic. This print runs with that concept, visualizing what New Hampshire would look like if "sea level" (cloud level) were at precisely 4000&#8242;. Lofty landforms become islands, rocks, and skerries, while other familiar landmarks transform into coves, harbors, and bays. Those new to hiking in the Whites will find their sea legs in places like "Tuckerman Harbor" and the &quot;Grand Kancamagus Banks&quot;. Seasoned trampers will delight in far-flung places such as &quot;Port Above Nubble&quot; and &quot;Barebooters Bight&quot;. The map&#x27;s novelty doesn't stop at the conceptual level, though.  Incorporating production methods normally reserved for wedding invitations, the print is letterpressed and foil stamped using tonal ink in conjunction with gold and silver matte foil on 100# Neenah Classic Crest &quot;chambray blue&quot; paper.
