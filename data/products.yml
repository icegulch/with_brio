  blurb: |
    Adapted from the USGS &quot;US Topo&quot; series contour lines, the fingerprints are foil stamped in silver matte on a 16&#8243; x 20&#8243; sheet of 100# Neenah Classic Crest "patriot blue" paper.

    Since summits vary greatly in size, creative license was invoked in fitting each peak into a grid. Indeed, many summit shapes were reduced in size, with contour lines pruned in as systematic a way as possible. In two cases (Lincoln and Wildcat B), contours were added to give a better sense of those two summits&#x27; shapes.

  title: "Undercast Approaches to the White Isles of New Hampshire"
  slug: undercast
  uri: "undercast-approaches-to-the-white-islands-of-new-hampshire"
  desc: "On those magical days when clouds settle in valleys and summits peek out above, you might find the landscape more nautical than orographic. This 18&#8243; x 12&#8243; letterpressed, foil-stamped print runs with that concept."
  retailers:
    - name: The Mountain Wanderer
      url: "http://www.mountainwanderer.com/"
  blurb: |
    This elegantly crafted map runs with that concept, revealing New Hampshire&#x27;s land above 4000&#8242; in a novel, elegant way. Lofty landforms become islands, rocks, and skerries, while other familiar landmarks transform into coves, harbors, and bays.

    Those new to hiking in the Whites will find their sea legs in places like "Tuckerman Harbor" and the &quot;Grand Kancamagus Banks&quot;. Seasoned trampers will delight in far-flung places such as &quot;Port Above Nubble&quot; and &quot;Barebooters Bight&quot;. The map&#x27;s novelty doesn't stop at the conceptual level, though. 

    Incorporating production methods normally reserved for wedding invitations, the 18&#8243; x 12&#8243; print is letterpressed and foil stamped using tonal ink in conjunction with gold and silver matte foil on 100# Neenah Classic Crest &quot;chambray blue&quot; paper.
