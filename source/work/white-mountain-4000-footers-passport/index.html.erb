                Designed to complement the Periodic Table of the White Mountain 4000-Footers poster, this pocket-size passport-style booklet is tailor-made for keeping track of your 4000-footer climbs. Bound with a handsome dark blue leatherette cover, it includes a page for each of the 48 peaks on which to log date, companions and hike notes. Included are two sets of small peel-off stamps for each peak&mdash;one to place on the individual peak page, and another to place on the two-page centerspread to track your overall progress in climbing the "48." The stamps are referenced to a peak abbreviation key on the back page of the passport, using the same format as the poster. 52 pp., 3 1/2" X 5."
