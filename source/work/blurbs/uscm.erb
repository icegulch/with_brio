  I used to ride my bike a lot in Boulder, even raced it <a href="http://bicyclerace.com/" target="_blank">uphill</a> on occasion.

  So, when my former agency asked if I'd be interested in redesigning a site to pitch the idea of a US Cycling Monument in Boulder, it took about a nanosecond to reply.

  Because USCM organizers were in fundraising mode, they asked if I could think of ways to encourage tiered-levels of support. A big fan of professional cycling's mountain pass ratings, I quickly borrowed from their rating levels and devised a giving campaign that they embraced enthusiastically.
